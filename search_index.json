This is where file command comes in.\nUsage: file pathToFile\nExample:\nfile ~/Pictures/thousandYearsOfPain.jpeg\n\n\n\nless\n\nVery frequently we feel the need to check the contents of the file. We can go ahead and open it in a GUI text editor, but that is not the linux way.\nUsage: less pathToFile\nSubcommands:\nq (Quit)\nPAGE UP or b (Scroll back one page)\nPAGE DOWN or space (Scroll forward one page)\nUp arrow (Scroll up one line)\nDown arrow (Scroll down one line)\nG (Move to the end of the text file)\n1G or g (Move to the beginning of the text file)\n/characters (Search forward to the next occurrence of characters)\nn (Search for the next occurrence of the previous search)\nh (Display help screen)\nq (Quit)\n\n\nLess is more\n\nSymbolic links\n\nWhen viewed in long list (ll) symbolic links seem to have the filetype l.\nSymbolic links are just like pointer variables, but instead of pointing to a variable they point to a file.\nSo the original file can now be referenced in two ways, either through the real file name or the name of the symlink.\nIf you write something to the symbolic link, the referenced file is written to.\nWhen you delete a symbolic link, however, only the link is deleted, not the file itself. If the file is deleted before the symbolic link, the link will continue to exist but will point to nothing.\nExamples:\nln -s ninja.scroll secret/forbidden.jutsu\nln -s acev2.txt ace.txt\n\n\n\nHard links\n\nBy default, every file has a single hard link that gives the file its name.\nWhen we create a hard link, we create an additional directory entry for a file.\nUnlike a symbolic link, when you list a directory containing a hard link, you will see no special indication of the link.\nA hard link cannot reference a file outside its own file system. This means a link cannot reference a file that is not on the same disk partition as the link itself.\nA hard link may not reference a directory.\nIf you write something to the hard link, the referenced file is written to.\nWhen a hard link is deleted, the link is removed, but the contents of the file itself continue to exist (that is, its space is not deallocated) until all links to the file are deleted.\nExamples:\nln momo dimsums\n\n\n\n"},"Linux/1-Basics/2-navigation.html":{"url":"Linux/1-Basics/2-navigation.html","title":"Navigation","keywords":"","body":"Basic navigation commands\npwd - present working directory\n\nUsing this command you can print the location of the directory you are working in.\nUsage: pwd\n\ncd - change directory\n\nUsing this command you can change your current working directory.\nUsage: cd path_to_directory\nIt accepts both absolute and relative paths\nShortcut for home is ~\nShortcut for previous working directory is -\nShortcut for someone else's home directory is ~username\nTo go to home dir just type cd\nExamples: \ncd ../parent\ncd ./child/grandChild\ncd /home/itachi/sharingan/ or cd ~/sharingan\ncd (will take you to home dir)\ncd ~levi (cd to levi's home directory)\n\n\n\nls - list\n\nUsing this command you can list the contents of any directory, as long as you have proper permissions.\nUsage: ls path\nThe file names starting with period (.) are hidden in linux.\nTo list the hidden files use -a flag.\nTo print additional info about the files and directories in linux use the -l flag, it stands for long list.\nTip: ll is an alias for ls -l\nIt accepts relative and absolute paths.\nYou can even specify multiple locations seperated by spaces.\nUse -h flag to display file sizes in human readable format rather than in bytes.\nLong list:\nExamples:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 sup3r541y4n sup3r541y4n 2180 Dec  5 20:43  navigation.md\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 sup3r541y4n sup3r541y4n 184 Dec  5 20:41 Linux\n\n\nThe first character represents the type of file (directory(d), file(-), symbolic link(l), character special file(c) and block special file(b))\nThe next 3 characters represent the file permissions of the owner (read(r), write(w) and execute(x))\nRead:\nFile: Allows a file to be opened and read.\nDirectory: Allows a directory’s contents to be listed if the execute attribute is also set.\n\n\nWrite:\nFile: Allows a file to be written to or truncated; however, this attribute does not allow files to be renamed or deleted. The ability to delete or rename files is determined by directory attributes.\nDirectory: Allows files within a directory to be created, deleted, and renamed if the execute attribute is also set.\n\n\nExecute:\nFile: Allows a file to be treated as a program and executed.

Then divide the result by 8, note the remainder. Now repeat last two steps with the new quotient till the quotient is 0. Then write the found remainders in reverse order. But since in permissions you cannot go beyond octal 7, no need to do divide steps.\nExample: \nrwx would become 111 which would be (1(2^2) + 1(2^1) + 1*(2^0)) = 7\nrw- would become 110 which would be (1(2^2) + 1(2^1) + 0*(2^0)) = 6\nr-x would become 101 which would be (1(2^2) + 0(2^1) + 1*(2^0)) = 5\n--- would become 000 which would be (0(2^2) + 0(2^1) + 0*(2^0)) = 0\n\n\nTip: \nInstead of doing 2^(n-1) you can simple remember these numbers-> 4, 2, 1\nSo 4 is for r, 2 is for w and 1 is for x.\nIf you want r-x you can simply add the required numbers, 4+1 = 5.\n\n\nExamples:\nchmod 777 secret.txt\nchmod 600 secretFile.txt\nchmod 755 impDir/\n\n\n\n\nSymbolic representation:\n\nIt specifies who the change will affect, what operation would be performed and what permissions will be set.\nTo specify who use u, g, o or a:\nu - Stands for user basically the file owner\ng - Group owner\no - Others\na - All (default)\n\n\nThe operation performed can be -, + or =:\n- - To remove certain permissions.\n+ - To add certain permissions.\n= - To specify certain permissions to be applied and remove the other permissions.\n\n\nTo specify the permissions that will be set use r, w or x:\nr - Read\nw - Write\nx - Execute\n\n\nExamples:\nchmod u+x file\nchmod u-w joeMama.txt\nchmod +x notImpFile.sh\nchmod o-rw someFile.dat\nchmod go=rw tbbt.mp4\nchmod u+x,go=rx trojan.horse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\numask - Set default permissions\n\nIt is used to set the default permissions of the file when it is first created.\nUsage: umask maskToApply\nBy default the mask is set to 0002 or 0022. So in case of 0022 files have permission set to rw-r--r-- by default.\nSo if we set the mask to 0000, we will notice that the files created after that will have rw-rw-rw- permissions (This is without any mask i.e. 0000).\nReason: \nConvert all bits of 0022 to 3 digit binary, you get (000 000 010 010).\n--- rw- rw- rw- Without mask\n000 000 010 010 Mask(0022) \n--- rw- r-- r-- Result\nSo we can see that the mask removes the permissions from the bits that are set.\n\n\n\nSpecial permissions\n\nSetuid bit (octal 4000), if this is applied to an executable file, it changes the effective user ID from that of the real user (the user actually running the program) to that of the program’s owner.

If the setgid bit is set on a directory, newly created files in the directory will be given the group ownership of the directory rather the group ownership of the file’s creator.\nSticky bit (octal 1000), if applied to a directory, it prevents users from deleting or renaming files unless the user is either the owner of the directory, the owner of the file, or the superuser.

You can run some powerful command-line stuff from there.\n\nBasic change/insert operations\n\ni: insert before the cursor.\na: append after the cursor.\nI: insert at the beginning if the line.\nA: append at the end of the line.\no: open a new line below the current line.\nO: open a new line above the current one.\nr: replace the once character under your cursor.\nR: replace the character under your cursor but just keep typing afterwards.\nc: change whatever you define as a movement, e.g. a word, or a sentence, or a paragraph.\nC: change the current line from where you're at.\ns: substitute from where you are to the next command (noun).\nS: substitute the entire current line.\n\nChanging case:\n\nYou can change case using ~.\nIt works on the letter under the cursor or on a selection.\n\nDeleting text\n\nx: exterminate (delete) the character under the cursor.\nX: exterminate (delete) the character before the cursor.\nd: delete whatever you define as a movement, e.g. a word, or a sentence, or a paragraph.\ndd: delete the current line.\ndt: delete delete from where you are to be period.\nD: delete to the end of the line.\nJ: join the current line with the next one(delete what's between).\n\nUndo and redo\n\nu: undo\nCTRL+r: redo\n\nRepeating actions\n\nYou can use . to repeat your last action.\nDelete a word: dw\nRepeat above action 5 times: 5.\n\nCopying and pasting\n\ny: yank (copy) from where you are to the next command (noun).\nyy: a shortcut for copying the current line.\np: paste the copied (or deleted) text after the current cursor position.\nP: paste the copied (or deleted) text before the current cursor position.\n\nSubstitution\n\nChange foo to bar on every line: :%s /foo/bar/g\nChange foo to bar on just the current line: :s /foo/bar/g\n\nMaking things repeatable\n\nSo let's say that you're adding a bit of text to the end of multiple lines, but you're only doing it where the line contains a certain string. You can accomplish that like so:\nSearch for the string: /delhi\nNow, whenever you press the n key you'll teleport to the next instance of \"delhi\". So, starting at the first one, we're going to append some text.\nAppend some text to the end of the line: A[has good street food][ESC]\nGo to the next instance and append the text to the line: n.\n\nText objects\n\nWord text objects\niw: inside a word.\naw: around a word.\nExamples:\nDelete a word: daw\nChange inside word: ciw\n\n\n\n\nSentence text objects\nis: inside sentence.\nas: around sentence.\nExample:\nChange around sentence: cas\n\n\n\n\nMore object types:\nparagraphs: ip and ap\nsingle quotes: i' and a'\ndouble quotes: i\" and a\"\nback tics: i`  and a` \nparanthesis: i( and a(\nbrackets: i[ and a[\nbraces: i{ and a{\ntags: it and at\n\n\n\nVisual mode\n\nPerhaps the best thing to say about Visual Mode is that it magnifies the power of everything you've learned so far. It does this by allowing you to apply commands to the text that's currently highlighted.\nEntering the visual mode:\nv: character based.\nV: line based.\nCTRL+v: paragraphs\n\n\nOften time you'll be inside some content that is surrounded on both sides by something, such as , . ( { [. You can visually select these things by issuing commands like these:\nSelect inside of parenthesis: vi(\nSelect around brackets: va[\nYou can also add a number to that to select two levels out (if you're inside a nested set).\nSelect everything inside the second tier braces: v2i{\n\nActions you can perform on visually selected text\n\nIt's really your choice, but the most common operations are simply deletion, copy, and paste.\nvwwy: Enter visual mode, select two more words of text and copy them.\nv6wy: Enter visual mode, select 6 words and copy them.\nVjjd: Enter line-based visual mode and delete a couple of lines below.\nvip: Visually select an entire paragraph.\nvipyjjp Visually select an entire paragraph then paste it down below.\n\nCombining visual mode with repetition\n\nIf we want to prepend a colon in front of every line, you can simply put one in front of the first line, visually select all the lines below it, and then hit the . key.\n\nMacros\n\nThey are used to record EVERYTHING you do and then doing it again when you replay. Here's a simple reference:\nqa: start recording a macro named \"a\"\nq: stop recording\n@a: play back the macro.\n\n"},"Linux/1-Basics/12-customizingOurPrompt.html":{"url":"Linux/1-Basics/12-customizingOurPrompt.html","title":"Prompt cutomization","keywords":"","body":"Customize the prompt in your terminal\nPS1 variable\n\nThe PS1 (Prompt String 1) environment variable stores your prompt string value.\nYou can change it by assigning it a new value like so:\n`PS1=\"$ \"\n\n\nBut before you change that remember to store your PS1 variable in another variable.
