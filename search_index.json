If the file is deleted before the symbolic link, the link will continue to exist but will point to nothing.\nExamples:\nln -s ninja.scroll secret/forbidden.jutsu\nln -s acev2.txt ace.txt\n\n\n\nHard links\n\nBy default, every file has a single hard link that gives the file its name.\nWhen we create a hard link, we create an additional directory entry for a file.\nUnlike a symbolic link, when you list a directory containing a hard link, you will see no special indication of the link.\nA hard link cannot reference a file outside its own file system. This means a link cannot reference a file that is not on the same disk partition as the link itself.\nA hard link may not reference a directory.\nIf you write something to the hard link, the referenced file is written to.\nWhen a hard link is deleted, the link is removed, but the contents of the file itself continue to exist (that is, its space is not deallocated) until all links to the file are deleted.\nExamples:\nln momo dimsums\n\n\n\n"},"Linux/1-Basics/2-navigation.html":{"url":"Linux/1-Basics/2-navigation.html","title":"Navigation","keywords":"","body":"Basic navigation commands\npwd - present working directory\n\nUsing this command you can print the location of the directory you are working in.\nUsage: pwd\n\ncd - change directory\n\nUsing this command you can change your current working directory.\nUsage: cd path_to_directory\nIt accepts both absolute and relative paths\nShortcut for home is ~\nShortcut for previous working directory is -\nShortcut for someone else's home directory is ~username\nTo go to home dir just type cd\nExamples: \ncd ../parent\ncd ./child/grandChild\ncd /home/itachi/sharingan/ or cd ~/sharingan\ncd (will take you to home dir)\ncd ~levi (cd to levi's home directory)\n\n\n\nls - list\n\nUsing this command you can list the contents of any directory, as long as you have proper permissions.\nUsage: ls path\nThe file names starting with period (.) are hidden in linux.\nTo list the hidden files use -a flag.\nTo print additional info about the files and directories in linux use the -l flag, it stands for long list.\nTip: ll is an alias for ls -l\nIt accepts relative and absolute paths.\nYou can even specify multiple locations seperated by spaces.\nUse -h flag to display file sizes in human readable format rather than in bytes.\nLong list:\nExamples:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 sup3r541y4n sup3r541y4n 2180 Dec  5 20:43  navigation.md\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 sup3r541y4n sup3r541y4n 184 Dec  5 20:41 Linux\n\n\nThe first character represents the type of file (directory(d), file(-), symbolic link(l), character special file(c) and block special file(b))\nThe next 3 characters represent the file permissions of the owner (read(r), write(w) and execute(x))\nRead:\nFile: Allows a file to be opened and read.\nDirectory: Allows a directory’s contents to be listed if the execute attribute is also set.\n\n\nWrite:\nFile: Allows a file to be written to or truncated; however, this attribute does not allow files to be renamed or deleted.

Then divide the result by 8, note the remainder. Now repeat last two steps with the new quotient till the quotient is 0. Then write the found remainders in reverse order. But since in permissions you cannot go beyond octal 7, no need to do divide steps.\nExample: \nrwx would become 111 which would be (1(2^2) + 1(2^1) + 1*(2^0)) = 7\nrw- would become 110 which would be (1(2^2) + 1(2^1) + 0*(2^0)) = 6\nr-x would become 101 which would be (1(2^2) + 0(2^1) + 1*(2^0)) = 5\n--- would become 000 which would be (0(2^2) + 0(2^1) + 0*(2^0)) = 0\n\n\nTip: \nInstead of doing 2^(n-1) you can simple remember these numbers-> 4, 2, 1\nSo 4 is for r, 2 is for w and 1 is for x.\nIf you want r-x you can simply add the required numbers, 4+1 = 5.\n\n\nExamples:\nchmod 777 secret.txt\nchmod 600 secretFile.txt\nchmod 755 impDir/\n\n\n\n\nSymbolic representation:\n\nIt specifies who the change will affect, what operation would be performed and what permissions will be set.\nTo specify who use u, g, o or a:\nu - Stands for user basically the file owner\ng - Group owner\no - Others\na - All (default)\n\n\nThe operation performed can be -, + or =:\n- - To remove certain permissions.\n+ - To add certain permissions.\n= - To specify certain permissions to be applied and remove the other permissions.\n\n\nTo specify the permissions that will be set use r, w or x:\nr - Read\nw - Write\nx - Execute\n\n\nExamples:\nchmod u+x file\nchmod u-w joeMama.txt\nchmod +x notImpFile.sh\nchmod o-rw someFile.dat\nchmod go=rw tbbt.mp4\nchmod u+x,go=rx trojan.horse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\numask - Set default permissions\n\nIt is used to set the default permissions of the file when it is first created.\nUsage: umask maskToApply\nBy default the mask is set to 0002 or 0022. So in case of 0022 files have permission set to rw-r--r-- by default.\nSo if we set the mask to 0000, we will notice that the files created after that will have rw-rw-rw- permissions (This is without any mask i.e. 0000).\nReason: \nConvert all bits of 0022 to 3 digit binary, you get (000 000 010 010).\n--- rw- rw- rw- Without mask\n000 000 010 010 Mask(0022) \n--- rw- r-- r-- Result\nSo we can see that the mask removes the permissions from the bits that are set.\n\n\n\nSpecial permissions\n\nSetuid bit (octal 4000), if this is applied to an executable file, it changes the effective user ID from that of the real user (the user actually running the program) to that of the program’s owner.

If the setgid bit is set on a directory, newly created files in the directory will be given the group ownership of the directory rather the group ownership of the file’s creator.\nSticky bit (octal 1000), if applied to a directory, it prevents users from deleting or renaming files unless the user is either the owner of the directory, the owner of the file, or the superuser.

This option is automatically applied when the -delete action is specified.\n-maxdepth levels - Set the maximum number of levels that find will descend into a directory tree when performing tests and actions.\n-mindepth levels - Set the minimum number of levels that find will descend into a directory tree before applying tests and actions.\n-mount - Direct find not to traverse directories that are mounted on other file systems.\n-noleaf - Direct find not to optimize its search based on the assumption that it is searching a\nUnix-like file system. This is needed when scanning DOS/Windows file systems and CD-ROMs.\n\n\nExamples:\nfind ~\nfind ~ | wc -l\nfind ~ -type d\nfind ~ -type f -user sup3r541y4n\nfind ~ -type f -name \"*.JPG\" -size +1M\nfind ~ \\( -type f -not -perm 0600 \\) -or \\( -type d -not -perm 0700 \\)\nfind ~ -type f -name '*.bak' -delete\nfind ~ -type f -name 'foo*' -exec ls -l '{}' ';'\n\n\n\nxargs - Build and execute command lines from standard input\n\nThis command takes input from stdin and turns it into an argument list for a specified command.\nthe xargs command has the --null (or -0 ) option, which accepts null-separated input. Useful when we use -print0 in find command.\nExample:\nfind ~ -type f -name 'foo*' -print | xargs ls -l\n\n\n\ntouch - Manipulate file times\n\nTouch is used to manipulate timestamps of a file, like access time and modification time.\nIf no option is specified it will just make an empty file.\nUsage: touch [OPTIONS] [FILE]\nExamples:\ntouch file.dat\ntouch -t 01301030 file.dat\ntouch -d \"Nov 5\" file.dat\n\n\n\nstat - Display file or file system status\n\nThe stat command reveals all that the system understands about a file and its attributes.\nUsage: stat file\nExample:\nstat file.dat\n\n\n\n"},"Linux/2-TasksAndTools/5-archivingAndBackup.html":{"url":"Linux/2-TasksAndTools/5-archivingAndBackup.html","title":"Archiving and backup","keywords":"","body":"Learn how to compress and archive your files\ngzip\n\nThe gzip program is used to compress one or more files.
