# Customize the prompt in your terminal

## PS1 variable
- The PS1 (Prompt String 1) environment variable stores your prompt string value.
- You can change it by assigning it a new value like so:
  - `PS1="$ "`
- But before you change that remember to store your PS1 variable in another variable. Just in case we mess anything up:
  - `oldPS1=$PS1`
